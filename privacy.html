            <p>Welcome to SHADER7.com ("we", "us", "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information on our website and with our tools. Your use of this website signifies your acceptance of this policy.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl mt-6 mb-3">A Note on Our Tools: Your Data is Yours</h2>
            <p class="font-bold text-indigo-700">The most important thing to know is that our tools (Passport Photo Creator, Resume Maker, etc.) process your data entirely within your web browser on your device. We do not upload, save, view, or have any access to the files (like photos) or personal information (like resume details) you input into these tools. Your data remains on your computer.</p>

            <p>You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites.</p>
