                </header>

                <p>In todayâ€™s competitive job market, a resume is more than just a document; it's your personal marketing tool. With recruiters spending only a few seconds scanning each application, a well-crafted resume is essential to making a strong first impression and landing an interview. But what makes a resume truly stand out in 2025?</p>
                <p>This guide will walk you through the key sections of a modern, professional resume, providing actionable tips to help you showcase your skills and experience effectively.</p>

                <h2>1. The Foundation: Contact Information & Professional Summary</h2>
                <p>Before a hiring manager dives into your experience, they need to know who you are and how to reach you. Get these basics right to ensure a smooth process.</p>
                
                <h3>Contact Information</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Include your <strong>full name</strong>, phone number, and a professional email address (<em>firstname.lastname@email.com</em>).</li>
                    <li>Add a link to your <strong>LinkedIn profile</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Your physical address is no longer necessary; a city and state are sufficient.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Professional Summary</h3>
                <p>Replace the outdated "Objective" statement with a powerful <strong>Professional Summary</strong>. This is a 2-4 sentence elevator pitch at the top of your resume that highlights your most relevant qualifications and career goals. It should be tailored to the specific job you're applying for.</p>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> "Detail-oriented Mechanical Engineer with over 5 years of experience in product design and CNC machining. Proven ability to lead projects from concept to completion, resulting in a 15% reduction in production costs at my previous role. Seeking to leverage my skills in automation and quality control to contribute to a forward-thinking engineering team."</p>
                </div>

                <h2>2. The Core: Your Work Experience</h2>
                <p>This is the most critical section of your resume. Donâ€™t just list your job duties; demonstrate your accomplishments.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use Action Verbs:</strong> Start each bullet point with a strong action verb (e.g., <em>Managed, Developed, Engineered, Coordinated, Implemented</em>).</li>
                    <li><strong>Quantify Your Achievements:</strong> Whenever possible, use numbers and data to show the impact of your work. Instead of saying, "Responsible for improving efficiency," say, "Implemented a new workflow that improved team efficiency by 25%."</li>
                    <li><strong>Follow the STAR Method:</strong> For each bullet point, briefly describe the <strong>Situation</strong>, the <strong>Task</strong> you needed to complete, the <strong>Action</strong> you took, and the <strong>Result</strong> of that action. This creates a compelling narrative of your accomplishments.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Highlighting Your Abilities: The Skills Section</h2>
                <p>The skills section provides a quick snapshot of your capabilities. It's crucial to tailor this section to the keywords listed in the job description.</p>
                
                <h3>Hard Skills</h3>
                <p>These are teachable, technical abilities. For a professional, this could include software (e.g., AutoCAD, SolidWorks, Microsoft Office Suite), programming languages, or specific machinery operation.</p>
                
                <h3>Soft Skills</h3>
                <p>These are interpersonal qualities that describe how you work and interact with others. Examples include Communication, Teamwork, Problem-Solving, and Leadership.</p>
                <p>Organize your skills into clear categories to make them easy for recruiters to scan.</p>

                <h2>4. Education & Certifications</h2>
                <p>Your educational background provides important context for your career.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Formatting:</strong> List your most recent degree first. Include the name of the institution, your degree, and your graduation date. You can omit your GPA unless you are a recent graduate and it was exceptionally high (3.5 or above).</li>
                    <li><strong>Certifications:</strong> If you have any professional certifications relevant to your industry (e.g., Project Management Professional (PMP), Six Sigma), create a separate section for them. This demonstrates a commitment to your professional development.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Final Touches: Formatting and Proofreading</h2>
                <p>A resume filled with typos and formatting errors can get you disqualified before your qualifications are even considered.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Keep it Clean:</strong> Use a modern, professional template with plenty of white space. Choose a standard, easy-to-read font like Inter, Arial, or Calibri. Keep the length to one page if you have less than 10 years of experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proofread Meticulously:</strong> Read your resume multiple times to check for spelling and grammar mistakes. Read it backward, from the last word to the first, to catch errors your brain might otherwise skip over. Ask a friend or colleague to review it as well.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A polished, error-free resume signals professionalism and attention to detailâ€”qualities every employer values.</p>
                
                <h2>Sample Professional Resume</h2>
                <p>Here is an example of what a complete, modern resume looks like, putting all the principles above into practice.</p>
