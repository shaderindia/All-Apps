            <p class="text-gray-500">Published: June 21, 2025</p>

            <p>Whether you're new to the Romanian job market or just want to better understand your payslip, the difference between gross salary (salariu brut) and net salary (salariu net) is fundamental. The number in your employment contract is often the gross amount, but the money that hits your bank account is the net. Let's break down where the money goes.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl mt-6 mb-3">What is Gross Salary?</h2>
            <p>Your <strong>gross salary</strong> is the total amount of money your employer agrees to pay you before any taxes or social contributions are deducted. This is the top-line figure you see in your employment contract (contract individual de muncă).</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl mt-6 mb-3">The Key Deductions</h2>
            <p>In Romania, there are three main mandatory contributions deducted directly from your gross salary. As of early 2025, the standard rates are:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700">
                <li><strong>Pension Contribution (CAS - Contribuția de Asigurări Sociale):</strong> This is a mandatory contribution to the state pension system. The standard rate is <strong>25%</strong> of your gross salary.</li>
                <li><strong>Health Insurance Contribution (CASS - Contribuția de Asigurări Sociale de Sănătate):</strong> This funds the public healthcare system. The rate is <strong>10%</strong> of your gross salary.</li>
                <li><strong>Income Tax (Impozit pe Venit):</strong> After the CAS and CASS are deducted, the remaining amount is subject to a flat income tax rate of <strong>10%</strong>. There are some <a href=\"#personal-deductions\">personal deductions</a> that can apply, potentially reducing this amount, but this is the general rule.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl mt-6 mb-3">Putting It All Together: An Example</h2>
            <p>Let's say your gross salary is <strong>5,000 RON</strong>.</p>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-700">
                <li><strong>CAS (25%):</strong> 5,000 * 0.25 = 1,250 RON</li>
                <li><strong>CASS (10%):</strong> 5,000 * 0.10 = 500 RON</li>
                <li><strong>Taxable Income:</strong> 5,000 - 1,250 - 500 = 3,250 RON</li>
                <li><strong>Income Tax (10%):</strong> 3,250 * 0.10 = 325 RON</li>
                <li><strong>Net Salary (Take-Home Pay):</strong> 5,000 - 1,250 - 500 - 325 = <strong>2,925 RON</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>As you can see, the total deductions add up significantly. Understanding this breakdown is key to effective financial planning.</p>

            <h2 id=\"personal-deductions\" class=\"text-2xl sm:text-3xl mt-6 mb-3\">What About Personal Deductions?</h2>
            <p>Romania's tax system allows for some <a href=\"#\">personal deductions</a> that can slightly reduce your taxable income, thus increasing your net pay. These typically depend on factors like whether you have dependents. However, the impact on your final net salary is often less significant than the main CAS and CASS contributions. For a precise calculation including personal deductions, consider using a dedicated <a href=\"./romaniasalarycalculator.html\">salary calculator</a>.</p>
