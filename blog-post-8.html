                    <p class="mt-6 text-xl text-gray-500">Mastering email etiquette is a critical career skill. Follow these simple rules to ensure your messages are clear, respected, and effective.</p>
                </header>

                <p>In the modern workplace, email is one of our primary forms of communication. We use it to connect with colleagues, clients, and potential employers. However, a poorly written email can cause confusion, project unprofessionalism, or simply get ignored. A great email, on the other hand, can build relationships and drive action.</p>
                <p>Whether you're sending a job application, a project update, or a simple request, following a few key principles of email etiquette can make all the difference. Hereâ€™s how to write a professional email that commands attention and gets results.</p>

                <h2>1. Craft a Clear and Concise Subject Line</h2>
                <p>The subject line is the first thing your recipient sees. It should be informative and concise, telling the reader exactly what the email is about before they even open it. Vague subject lines like "Question" or "Following up" are easily overlooked in a crowded inbox.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bad Subject:</strong> Meeting</li>
                    <li><strong>Good Subject:</strong> Marketing Meeting Canceled: Rescheduled for Friday, Aug 22nd at 10 AM</li>
                    <li><strong>Bad Subject:</strong> My Resume</li>
                    <li><strong>Good Subject:</strong> Job Application: Alex Carter for Mechanical Engineer Position</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. Use a Professional Salutation</h2>
                <p>How you greet the recipient sets the tone for the entire message. The right salutation depends on your relationship with the person.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Formal:</strong> Use "Dear Mr./Ms./Dr. [Last Name]," when writing to someone you don't know or someone in a position of authority.</li>
                    <li><strong>Semi-Formal:</strong> "Hello [First Name]," or "Hi [First Name]," is appropriate for colleagues you work with regularly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid being too casual:</strong> Steer clear of informal greetings like "Hey," or "Yo," in a professional context. When in doubt, err on the side of formality.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Get Straight to the Point</h2>
                <p>Professionals are busy. They appreciate emails that are direct and easy to scan. State your purpose in the first sentence or two. Avoid long, rambling introductions.</p>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> "I hope you are having a good week. I was just thinking about the project we discussed last Tuesday and had a few thoughts I wanted to run by you when you have a moment."</p>
                    <p><strong>Try this:</strong> "I have a quick question about the Q3 project timeline. Could you clarify if the deadline is EOD Friday or Monday?"</p>
                </div>

                <h2>4. Keep Your Formatting Clean and Readable</h2>
                <p>A giant wall of text is intimidating and hard to read. Break up your message into short paragraphs to improve readability. Use bullet points or numbered lists to present complex information or a series of questions. This makes your email scannable and ensures the recipient can easily identify the key points and required actions.</p>

                <h2>5. End with a Clear Call to Action and a Professional Closing</h2>
                <p>Don't leave your recipient wondering what you want from them. Your email should clearly state the desired next step. This is your "call to action."</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Could you please review this draft by 3 PM tomorrow?"</li>
                    <li>"Let me know what time works for a brief call next week."</li>
                    <li>"Please let me know if you need any more information from my end."</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Finally, end your email with a professional closing, followed by your name and title. Standard closings like "Best regards," "Sincerely," "Thank you," or "All the best," are always safe choices.</p>
                
                <h3>Putting It All Together: A Quick Checklist</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Subject Line:</strong> Is it clear and specific?</li>
                    <li><strong>Salutation:</strong> Is it appropriate for your audience?</li>
                    <li><strong>Body:</strong> Is it concise, clear, and easy to read?</li>
                    <li><strong>Call to Action:</strong> Is it obvious what you need the recipient to do?</li>
                    <li><strong>Closing:</strong> Is it professional?</li>
                    <li><strong>Proofread:</strong> Have you checked for typos and grammar errors?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By treating every email as a reflection of your professionalism, you build a reputation as a clear, respectful, and effective communicatorâ€”a skill that is invaluable in any career.</p>
