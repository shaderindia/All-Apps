    <div class="question">Are SHADER7 tools really free forever?</div>
    <div class="answer">Yes. Every tool is 100% free with no limits, no premium tiers, and no registration. We sustain through voluntary donations and privacy-focused ads.</div>

</div>

<div class="faq-item">
    <div class="question">How do you make money if everything is free?</div>
