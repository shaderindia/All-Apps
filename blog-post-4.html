                    <p class="mt-6 text-xl text-gray-500">Choosing the right image format can dramatically impact your website's speed and quality. Learn the pros and cons of each.</p>
                </header>

                <p>In the digital world, images are everything. They capture attention, convey emotion, and break up text. But not all image files are created equal. Using the wrong format can lead to slow-loading pages, blurry visuals, and a poor user experience. The three most common formats you'll encounter on the web are JPEG, PNG, and the newer WebP.</p>
                <p>Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each is essential for web designers, content creators, and anyone who wants to optimize their digital presence. Let's break down when to use each format.</p>

                <h2>JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)</h2>
                <p>JPEG is the most popular image format in the world, and for good reason. It's the king of photographs and complex, colorful images.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best For:</strong> Photographs, realistic images with millions of colors, gradients, and complex textures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compression:</strong> JPEGs use "lossy" compression. This means that when you save an image as a JPEG, some data is permanently discarded to reduce the file size. You can control the level of compression, but the smaller the file size, the more the quality degrades.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> JPEGs do not support transparency. If you need an image with a clear background (like a logo), JPEG is not the right choice.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Use JPEG when:</strong> You are displaying a photograph of a person, a landscape, or a product. The primary goal is to keep the file size small without a noticeable loss in quality.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>PNG (Portable Network Graphics)</h2>
                <p>PNG is the go-to format for graphics that require sharp lines and transparency. It was originally developed as a superior alternative to the older GIF format.</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best For:</strong> Logos, icons, illustrations, text-heavy images, and any graphic that requires a transparent background.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compression:</strong> PNGs use "lossless" compression. This means that no data is lost when the file is compressed. The image quality remains perfect, but this often results in larger file sizes compared to JPEGs, especially for complex photographs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> This is PNG's superpower. It supports full alpha channel transparency, allowing for smooth, clear backgrounds that blend seamlessly into any webpage design.</li>
                </ul>
                 <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Use PNG when:</strong> You need a logo with a transparent background, an icon, or a screenshot where text needs to be perfectly crisp and readable. Quality and transparency are more important than file size.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>WebP (Web Picture Format)</h2>
                <p>Developed by Google, WebP is a modern format designed to provide superior compression for the web, combining the best features of both JPEG and PNG.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best For:</strong> Almost everything. WebP is a versatile format that can replace both JPEG and PNG for most web use cases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compression:</strong> WebP can use both lossy and lossless compression. On average, lossy WebP images are 25-34% smaller than comparable JPEGs, and lossless WebP images are about 26% smaller than comparable PNGs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Like PNG, WebP supports lossless transparency, but with a much smaller file size.</li>
                    <li><strong>Browser Support:</strong> This used to be WebP's main weakness, but today it is supported by all modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Use WebP when:</strong> Your primary goal is website performance and speed. Converting your JPEGs and PNGs to WebP is one of the most effective ways to reduce page load times without sacrificing quality.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h2>Quick Decision Guide</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Is it a photograph? <strong>Start with JPEG, but consider converting to WebP for better performance.</strong></li>
                    <li>Does it need a transparent background? <strong>Use PNG, or convert to WebP for a smaller file size.</strong></li>
                    <li>Is it a simple logo or illustration with sharp lines? <strong>Use PNG or lossless WebP.</strong></li>
                    <li>Is website speed your top priority? <strong>Use WebP for everything.</strong></li>
                </ul>
